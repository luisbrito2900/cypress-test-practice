## Must know

- A custom POM Pattern with Javascript and Cypress was used.

- The data is stored on `cypress.env.json` for each test case.

- The magento website use to make test fail sometimes so that's why retries are applied in the config.js file.

- Pipeline integration is not possible because this website it's blocking correct pipeline execution.

- The ESLint linter was implemented to ensure the best practices and performance of the code.
